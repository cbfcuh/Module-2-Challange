                <p>
                    In this recent application that was completed, I was tasked with altering the webpages code base to reach accesbility standards by refactoring the code to follow a semantic HTML structure without it affecting the webpages functionality. In addition to that, we had to add in relevant tags throughout the HTML file to improve the webpages seo and reach a larger audience.
