# My Portfolio

## Description
This portoflio was created in order to display the skills I have learnt and actively use what I have learnt in the past few weeks. By applying semantic HTML and CSS techniques I hope to demonstrate the cultivation of my studies and progress my career as a web developer.

During this challenge I have grasped the idea of how to build a web application utlising both HTML and CSS. Also by applying the relavant styles to my CSS I was able to conjure a responsive application to varying sizes of screens.
